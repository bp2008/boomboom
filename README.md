A bomberman clone which I originally released on the Ouya console in 2013.

## Building From Source

As this is not an actively developed project, getting it to build may get trickier as time goes on.  I rebuilt the project in December 2017 using Android studio 3.x, and it still builds as of October 2020 using Android Studio 4.0.1.  Android Studio should more or less guide you through installing the necessary SDK version (27 / Android 8.1) and related tools.  I didn't allow it to upgrade gradle from version 3.0.1 or something as I vaguely recall compatibility issues with the game engine this is built on (libGDX).
